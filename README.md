# GANasso - Generative Adversial neural network Picasso
Pytorch implementation of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cDCGAN) and Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversial Networks (ACDCGAN) for MNIST [2] and Kaggle dataset

* report folder contains a report of this implementation. Look that if you want to get more deep into details

* We used both cDCGAN and ACDCGAN to create new paintings from total of 4 different labels.
